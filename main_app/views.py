# Create your views here.

# In Django, a view function is similar to what you may know as a "route handler" in Express. It's where you define the logic that gets executed in response to a specific HTTP request.

# For our cat-collector application, let's start by creating a basic view function that will serve as the response for the home page. We'll define this function in main_app/views.py.

# define home view function, passing request object(?)
def home(request):
    # return HttpResponse('<h1>Hello ·ìö·òè·ó¢</h1>')
    # remove above line to instead render new home.html template:
    return render(request, 'home.html')

def about(request):
    # return HttpResponse('<h1>About the CatCollector</h1>')
    return render(request, 'about.html')
        # The render() shortcut in Django is similar to Express' res.render(), except for the positional request arg. Also, the .html extension is required. For more on render(), check out more in the Django docs.

# now we're removing the hardcoded data so we can render the cats added to using the ORM:
# class Cat:
#     # initialize what a cat will be
#     def __init__(self, name, breed, description, age):
#         self.name = name 
#         self.breed = breed
#         self.description = description
#         self.age = age
    
# create a list of cat instances:
# cats = [
#     Cat('Ivy', 'torbie', 'the spoiled princess', 6),
#     Cat('Spoon', 'muted tortie', 'the aggressive snuggler', 8),
#     Cat('Garbanzo', 'orange tabby', 'the old man', 10),
# ]
    
    # üß† Note: Everything in a Python module is automatically exported, thus, the Cat class and the cats list will be accessible in other modules.

def cat_index(request):
    # return cat objects from cat array
    cats = Cat.objects.all()
        # remember this query from using it in the ORM?
    return render(request, 'cats/index.html', {'cats': cats})

    # Just like in Express, where data is passed to templates via an object, in Django, we use a dictionary. This dictionary is passed as the third argument to Django's render function, allowing the template to access the cat data.
    
    # We organize our templates by creating a dedicated directory for each type of entity. For the cats, we'll store their templates in templates/cats.

def cat_detail(request, cat_id):
    cat = Cat.objects.get(id=cat_id)
    feeding_form = FeedingForm()
    return render(request, 'cats/detail.html', {'cat': cat, 'feeding_form': feeding_form})

# adding a class
class CatCreate(CreateView):
    model = Cat
    fields = '__all__'
        # The fields attribute is required and can be used to limit or change the ordering of the attributes from the Cat model are generated in the ModelForm passed to the template.
        # We've taken advantage of the special '__all__' value to specify that the form should contain all of the Cat Model's attributes. Alternatively, we could have listed the fields in a list like this:
            # class CatCreate(CreateView):
                # model = Cat
                # fields = ['name', 'breed', 'description', 'age']
        # IOW: different users could have different abilities 
    # success_url = '/cats/'
        # commenting this out because apparently it's an outdate way of managing a redirect to a page other than index? we're using get_absolute_url method in the model instead. 
        # you'll see in CatDelete below, we will use this code because we need the page to redirect back to index since there's no cat entry to redirect to. 
        
class CatUpdate(UpdateView):
    model = Cat
    # pass specific fields that we want the user to be able to update (compared to '__all__')
    fields = ['breed', 'description', 'age']
    
class CatDelete(DeleteView):
    model = Cat
    success_url = '/cats/'
        # redirect back to the index

def add_feeding(request, cat_id):
    # create a ModelForm instance using the data in request.POST
    form = FeedingForm(request.POST)
    # validate the form
    if form.is_valid():
        # don't save the form to the db until it
        # has the cat_id assigned
        new_feeding = form.save(commit=False)
        new_feeding.cat_id = cat_id
        new_feeding.save()
    return redirect('cat-detail', cat_id=cat_id)
