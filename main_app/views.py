# Create your views here.

# In Django, a view function is similar to what you may know as a ‚Äúroute handler‚Äù in Express. It‚Äôs where you define the logic that gets executed in response to a specific HTTP request.

# For our cat-collector application, let‚Äôs start by creating a basic view function that will serve as the response for the home page. We‚Äôll define this function in main_app/views.py.

# define home view function, passing request object(?)
def home(request):
    # return HttpResponse('<h1>Hello ·ìö·òè·ó¢</h1>')
    # remove above line to instead render new home.html template:
    return render(request, 'home.html')

def about(request):
    # return HttpResponse('<h1>About the CatCollector</h1>')
    return render(request, 'about.html')
        # The render() shortcut in Django is similar to Express‚Äô res.render(), except for the positional request arg. Also, the .html extension is required. For more on render(), check out more in the Django docs.

# now we're removing the hardcoded data so we can render the cats added to using the ORM:
# class Cat:
#     # initialize what a cat will be
#     def __init__(self, name, breed, description, age):
#         self.name = name 
#         self.breed = breed
#         self.description = description
#         self.age = age
    
# create a list of cat instances:
# cats = [
#     Cat('Ivy', 'torbie', 'the spoiled princess', 6),
#     Cat('Spoon', 'muted tortie', 'the aggressive snuggler', 8),
#     Cat('Garbanzo', 'orange tabby', 'the old man', 10),
# ]
    
    # üß† Note: Everything in a Python module is automatically exported, thus, the Cat class and the cats list will be accessible in other modules.

def cat_index(request):
    # return cat objects from cat array
    cats = Cat.objects.all()
        # remember this query from using it in the ORM?
    return render(request, 'cats/index.html', {'cats': cats})

    # Just like in Express, where data is passed to templates via an object, in Django, we use a dictionary. This dictionary is passed as the third argument to Django‚Äôs render function, allowing the template to access the cat data.
    
    # We organize our templates by creating a dedicated directory for each type of entity. For the cats, we‚Äôll store their templates in templates/cats.

def cat_detail(request, cat_id):
    cat = Cat.objects.get(id=cat_id)
    # give us all toys that exist in the db:
    # toys = Toy.objects.all()
    # comment out above line and replace with below which only gets the toys that the cat does not have
    toys_cat_doesnt_have = Toy.objects.exclude(id__in = cat.toys.all().values_list('id'))
        # The first half of this expression Toy.objects.exclude(id__in = retrieves all Toy objects that do not have an id that is in the list of associated toy ids. The exclude() method is the opposite of filter(), which means it will get all toys except those whose ids are listed in the previous query. The id__in is a field lookup that checks if the id field of the Toy model is within the provided list.
        # The second half of this expression cat.toys.all().values_list('id') retrieves a list of ids for all the toys associated with a specific cat. This is done by first accessing all toy instances linked to the cat through the many-to-many relationship (cat.toys.all()), and then narrowing the data down to just the ids of these toys using values_list('id').
    # instantiate FeedingForm to be rendered in the template:
    feeding_form = FeedingForm()
    # just returning one cat:
    # and now include feeding_form in the context (in other words: set an instance of FeedingForm and then pass it to detail.html just like we did with cat)

        # The fields attribute is required and can be used to limit or change the ordering of the attributes from the Cat model are generated in the ModelForm passed to the template.
        # We‚Äôve taken advantage of the special '__all__' value to specify that the form should contain all of the Cat Model‚Äôs attributes. Alternatively, we could have listed the fields in a list like this:
            # class CatCreate(CreateView):
                # model = Cat
                # fields = ['name', 'breed', 'description', 'age']
        # IOW: different users could have different abilities 
    # success_url = '/cats/'
        # commenting this out because apparently it's an outdate way of managing a redirect to a page other than index? we're using get_absolute_url method in the model instead. 
        # you'll see in CatDelete below, we will use this code because we need the page to redirect back to index since there's no cat entry to redirect to. 
        
class CatUpdate(UpdateView):
    model = Cat
    # pass specific fields that we want the user to be able to update (compared to '__all__')
